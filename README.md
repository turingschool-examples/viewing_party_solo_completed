# Viewing Party Solo - Base Repo

This is the base repo for the [Viewing Party Solo project](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/viewing_party_solo) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Project

Viewing Party Solo is an application that allows users to explore movies and create a Viewing Party Event that invites users and keeps track of a host. Mainly, your job is to connect with an external API and collect relevant information on each movie, its cast, and other information, to display it on each Viewing Party page. 

## Setup

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}`

Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the functionality and structure of the application so far. 

When you run `bundle exec rspec`, you should have 26 passing tests (both features & models combined). 

### Use the application
`rails s`, navigate to `127.0.0.0:3000` and click around the site.
